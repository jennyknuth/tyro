##Getting My Feet Wet: my first programs

I am starting the journey to become a programmer. Of course, I want to learn best practices and find the best solutions. 
These are my first programs in Python as I take an introductory course at CU Boulder with David Graham. 
All feedback/suggestions welcome.
