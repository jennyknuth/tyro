##Getting my feet wet: my first programs

I am starting the journey to become a programmer. Of course, I want to learn best practices and find the best solutions. These are my first programs in Python as I take an introductory course with David Graham at CU Boulder. And that's Python 3, not sure they will all work the same in Python 2.

All feedback/suggestions welcome!
